Both the "susp.txt" and "freq.txt" text files along side the "apacheLogMenu-1.bash" bash file are recorded versions of the logs which are updated upon running either 
[5] frequent visitors, or [6] suspicous visitors. "ioc.txt" can be configured to have different filters for when running the suspicious visitors option.

The actual bash script can simply be ran without any perameters needed:

                       bash apacheLogMenu-1.bash 

*Not running as root may cause issues for saving to the two text files.*

Enjoy!
